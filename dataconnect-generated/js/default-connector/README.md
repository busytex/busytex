#  Generated TypeScript README
This README will guide you through the process of using the generated TypeScript SDK package for the connector `default`. It will also provide examples on how to use your generated SDK to call your Data Connect queries and mutations.

***NOTE:** This README is generated alongside the generated SDK. If you make changes to this file, they will be overwritten when the SDK is regenerated.*

You can use this generated SDK by importing from the package `@firebasegen/default-connector` as shown below. Both CommonJS and ESM imports are supported.
You can also follow the instructions from the [Data Connect documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect/web-sdk#set-client).

# Accessing the connector
A connector is a collection of queries and mutations. One SDK is generated for each connector - this SDK is generated for the connector `default`.

You can find more information about connectors in the [Data Connect documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect#how-does).

In order to call Data Connect queries and mutations, you need to create an instance of the connector in your application code.

```javascript
import { getDataConnect, DataConnect } from 'firebase/data-connect';
import { connectorConfig } from '@firebasegen/default-connector';

const connector: DataConnect = getDataConnect(connectorConfig);
```

## Connecting to the local Emulator
By default, the connector will connect to the production service.

To connect to the emulator, you can use the following code.
You can also follow the emulator instructions from the [Data Connect documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect/web-sdk#instrument-clients).

```javascript
// add connectDataConnectEmulator to your imports 
import { connectDataConnectEmulator, getDataConnect, DataConnect } from 'firebase/data-connect';
import { connectorConfig } from '@firebasegen/default-connector';

const connector: DataConnect = getDataConnect(connectorConfig);
connectDataConnectEmulator(connector, 'localhost', 9399);
```

After it's initialized, you can call your Data Connect [queries](#queries) and [mutations](#mutations) from your generated SDK. 

# Queries
No queries were generated for the `default` connector.

If you want to learn more about how to use queries in Data Connect, you can follow the examples from the [Data Connect documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect/web-sdk#using-queries).

# Mutations
No mutations were generated for the `default` connector.

If you want to learn more about how to use mutations in Data Connect, you can follow the examples from the [Data Connect documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect/web-sdk#using-mutations).
